Replecs provides ways to translate entities and components when you want to send them through the network.


## Translating Entities

Replecs has a lookup map that saves the client's equivalent of server entities. You can access this map from the client replicator.

- `client_replicator:get_server_entity(client_entity)` to translate a client entity to its equivalent in the server.
- `client_replicator:get_client_entity(server_entity)` to translate a server entity to its equivalent in the client.

## Translating Components

Replecs has a special way to translate components in a way that the client and server can agree on.
This system relies on the `replecs.shared` tag.

You can use this same system to serialize components that get sent through the network.

- `replicator:encode_component(component)` to encode a component. This returns a number between 1 to 255.
- `replicator:decode_component(number)` to decode a component. This takes the number from `encode_component`.

The methods for translating components are available in both the client and server replicators.
